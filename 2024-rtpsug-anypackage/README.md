## AnyPackage Presentation

This folder contains the [PowerPoint](AnyPackage.pptx) as well as the demo.

Each numbered folder is a self contained demo. Folders 1 through 8 contain steps
on how to create a fully functional package provider from scratch. There is also
the [function-provider-template] repository to get started building a package
provider.
